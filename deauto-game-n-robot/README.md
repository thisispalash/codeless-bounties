## The Story

The year is 2369. The great war at the turn of the century has blocked out the sun. The clear blue skies of the centuries past are now merely a dusty orange-brown. All it took was one erroneous mishap, one mistaken push of a button, one that started a chain reaction, metaphorically and literally, and ended life as we know it. But the thing about life is that it survives. It adapts, it mutates, and it survives. And mutate it did. Humanity's biggest challenge was not the lack of the sun. It was the mutations that came after.

Within the first decade humanity learned to live in the dark. It leveraged its ancestry of foraging, and its ability to innovate, to make food and water a plenty by the end of the decade. This is when the mutations began. The fallout from the deadly missiles had permeated everything, from trees to fish. And with humanity's continual exploitation of resources from the planet, the fallout had permeated humanity as well. As the concentration of the fallout increased within the humans, their genes began to change, eroding their humanity, and moving them closer to the realm of monsters. 

Over time, these monsters evolved into three distinct categories - the zombies, the powerful, and the intelligent. The _zombies_ are the least dangerous. Lacking cognitive functionality, _the zombies_ can be easily manipulated and overcome. Be careful not to get in contact with them however, since they can just as easily cause a mutation in you, turning you into a monster. The next in line of danger are _the powerful_. They have some cognitive ability, but that is to control the power they weild. There are many classes of the powerful; some can distort electrical signals, some can generate extreme levels of strength, while some others can infect a wider area. The most dangerous, and the rarest of the three are _the intelligent_. These monsters have the highest cognitive ability and can strategize and organise the other monsters.

Finally, about seven years ago, a massive solar flare knocked out most of humanity's technologies. The only surviving tech were those that were autonomous and isolated - ie, the Starlink communication network and the dozen NEV fabrication facilities.
